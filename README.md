# Typerunner Prototype

Welcome to the Typerunner Prototype repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and practice TypeScript programming by implementing a simple typing game.

## Description

Typerunner Prototype is a command-line typing game where players are challenged to type words as they appear on the screen before the timer runs out. It is a fun and interactive way to improve your typing speed and accuracy while getting familiar with TypeScript.

## Features

- Randomly generated words for typing practice
- Adjustable difficulty levels
- Time limit for each word
- Score tracking
- Interactive command-line interface

## Installation

To get started with Typerunner Prototype, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seo-asif/Typerunner-Prototype.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Typerunner-Prototype
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the TypeScript code:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

After completing the installation steps, you can run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the game starts, words will appear on the screen, and your goal is to type them correctly before the time runs out. Each correct word increases your score, while incorrect inputs decrease it. Try to achieve the highest score possible and improve your typing skills!
